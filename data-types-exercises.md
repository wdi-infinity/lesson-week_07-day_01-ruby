### Assorted Data Types

#### What are the outputs and/or side effects of the following code snippets?

* Make a guess before testing your answer.
* "Error out" is a valid answer choice.
* Also include a sentence on why you chose your answer.

```rb
2 ** 3
```
```text
222
// After testing this, I relize ** mens 2 * 2 3 times 

```

```rb
((16 / 4 ) * (2 + 1 )) ** 2
```
```text
 12 * 12 144
```

```rb
("a milli " + "a milli") * 3
```
```text
"a millia millia millia millia millia milli"

```

```rb
("a milli " * 4) / 2
```
```text
 error

```

```rb
my_favorite_number = 13
puts "My favorite number is: " + my_favorite_number
```
```text 
Error .  
Correct Answer => "My favorite number is: #{my_favorite_number}"
```

```rb
my_favorite_number = 13
puts "My favorite number is: #{my_favorite_number}"
```
```text
My favorite number is: 13 
```

### Truthiness and Falsiness

#### Which of these evaluate as `false` in Ruby? Mark all that apply.

```text
[X] false
[ ] 0
[ ] ""
[ ] null
[ ] [ ] (empty array)
[ ] undefined
[ ] NaN
[X] nil
```

#### What are the outputs and/or side effects of the following code snippets?

* Make a guess before testing your answer.
* "Error out" is a valid answer choice.
* Also include a sentence on why you chose your answer.

```rb 
# Question
no_name = ""
if no_name
  puts "My name is: " + no_name
end
```
```text
My name is 
```

```rb
no_name = nil
if no_name
  puts "My name is: " + no_name
end
```
```text
Error
```

```rb
age = 21
if age
  puts "My age is: " + no_name
end
```
```text
no_name was defined as empty string previously 
My age is 

```

```rb
age = gets.chomp
if age
  puts "My age is: " + age
end
```
```text
gets let the user enter a vlaue chomp removes /n
My age is 10 
```

### Conditionals

Write the code for the following exercise inside of the `app.rb` located in this repo. Run/test your code using `ruby app.rb` in the Terminal.

#### Write FizzBuzz in Ruby!

Fizz-Buzz is a classic coding exercise that you can create using your knowledge of conditionals and loops. Implement code that does the following...

* Counts from 1 to 100 and prints out something for each number.
* If the number is divisible by 3, print `"Fizz"`.
* If the number is divisible by 5, print `"Buzz"`.
* If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, print `"FizzBuzz"`.
* If the number does not meet any of the above conditions, just print the number.

Your output should look something like this...
```
1, 2, Fizz, 4, Buzz, Fizz, 7, 8, Fizz, Buzz, 11, Fizz, 13, 14, Fizz Buzz, 16, 17, Fizz, 19, Buzz, Fizz, 22, 23, Fizz, Buzz, 26, Fizz, 28, 29, Fizz Buzz, 31, 32, Fizz, 34, Buzz, Fizz, ...
```
