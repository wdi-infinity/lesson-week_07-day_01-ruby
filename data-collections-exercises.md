### Arrays

Starting with the following array...

```rb
planeteers = ["Earth", "Wind", "Captain Planet", "Fire", "Water"]
```

Access the second value in `planeteers`.

```rb
# Your answer here
puts planeteers[1]
```

Add "Heart" to the end of `planeteers`.

```rb
# Your answer here
planeteers.push('Heart')
```

Remove "Captain Planet" from the array (without using a method).

```rb
# Your answer here
planeteers -= ["Captain Planet"]
```

Combine `planeteers` with `rangers = ["Red", "Blue", "Pink", "Yellow", "Black"]` and save the result in a variable called `heroes`.

```rb
# Your answer here
rangers = ["Red", "Blue", "Pink", "Yellow", "Black"]
heroes = planeteers + rangers
```

Alphabetize the contents of `heroes` using a method. [The Ruby documentation might help](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.6.1/Array.html).

```rb
# Your answer here
heroes.sort!
```

Randomize the contents of `heroes` using a method. [The Ruby documentation might help](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.6.1/Array.html).

```rb
# Your answer here
heroes.shuffle!
```

#### Bonus

Select a random element from `heroes` using a method. [The Ruby documentation might help](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.6.1/Array.html).

```rb
# Your answer here
puts heroes.sample
```

Select all elements in `heroes` that begin with "B" using a method. [The Ruby documentation might help](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.6.1/Array.html).

```rb
# Your answer here
puts heroes.select { |hero| hero.start_with?('B') }
```

### Hashes

Initialize a hash called `ninja_turtle` with the properties `name`, `weapon` and `radical`. They should have values of "Michelangelo", "Nunchuks" and `true` respectively.

```rb
# Your answer here
ninja_turtle ={
    name: 'Michelangelo',
    weapon: 'Nunchuks',
    radical: true
}
```

Add a key `age` to `ninja_turtle`. Set it to whatever numerical value you'd like.

```rb
# Your answer here
 ninja_turtle[:age] = 23
```

Remove the `radical` key-value pair from `ninja_turtle`.

```rb
# Your answer here
ninja_turtle.delete(:radical)
```

Add a key `pizza_toppings` to `ninja_turtle`. Set it to an array of strings (e.g., `["cheese", "pepperoni", "peppers"]`).

```rb
# Your answer here
ninja_turtle[:pizza_toppings] = ["cheese", "pepperoni", "peppers"]
```

Access the first element of `pizza_toppings`.

```rb
# Your answer here
puts ninja_turtle[:pizza_toppings][0]
```

Produce an array containing all of `ninja_turtle`'s keys using a method. [The Ruby documentation might help](http://ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Hash.html).

```rb
# Your answer here
 allKeys = ninja_turtle.keys
```

#### Bonus

Print out each key-value pair in the following format - "KEY's is equal to VALUE" -- using a method. [The Ruby documentation might help](http://ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Hash.html).

```rb
# Your answer here
ninja_turtle.each { |key,value| puts "#{key}'s is equal to #{value}"}
```
